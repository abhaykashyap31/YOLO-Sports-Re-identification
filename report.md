# Report: Approaches Used and Rationale

## Overview

This project is structured for multi-camera video analysis, including cross-camera mapping, object detection, feature extraction, tracking, and re-identification. Below, we summarize the main approaches used in each module and the reasons for their selection.

---

## 1. Cross-Camera Mapping ([src/cross_camera_mapping.py](src/cross_camera_mapping.py))

**Approach:**  
- Implements spatial and/or temporal mapping between different camera views.
- Uses homography or geometric transformations to align fields of view.
- Associates object identities as they move between camera feeds.

**Why Used:**  
- Maintains consistent object identities across multiple cameras.
- Handles occlusions and blind spots by leveraging overlapping views.
- Essential for reconstructing full trajectories in multi-camera environments.

---

## 2. Cross-Camera Processing ([src/cross_camera.py](src/cross_camera.py))

**Approach:**  
- Integrates detection, tracking, and re-identification across camera feeds.
- Synchronizes frames and events between cameras.
- Merges object tracks using appearance and spatial features.

**Why Used:**  
- Improves tracking robustness when objects move between cameras.
- Reduces identity switches and fragmentation.
- Enables global analysis of player movement across the entire scene.

---

## 3. Object Detection ([src/detector.py](src/detector.py))

**Approach:**  
- Utilizes deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
- Detects players and other objects of interest in each frame.
- Applies confidence thresholds and non-maximum suppression.

**Why Used:**  
- Provides accurate and real-time detection necessary for downstream tasks.
- Handles varying lighting, occlusion, and camera angles.
- Forms the foundation for tracking and re-identification.

---

## 4. Feature Extraction ([src/features.py](src/features.py))

**Approach:**  
- Extracts appearance features using CNNs or pre-trained re-ID models.
- Generates compact feature vectors for each detected object.
- May include color histograms, pose, or texture features.

**Why Used:**  
- Enables distinguishing between visually similar players.
- Supports robust re-identification across frames and cameras.
- Reduces dimensionality for efficient matching and storage.

---

## 5. Tracking ([src/tracking.py](src/tracking.py))

**Approach:**  
- Implements multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT).
- Associates detections across frames using motion and appearance cues.
- Handles track initiation, update, and termination.

**Why Used:**  
- Maintains object identities over time within a single camera.
- Handles missed detections and short-term occlusions.
- Provides temporal continuity for analysis and statistics.

---

## 6. Single-Feed Processing ([src/single_feed.py](src/single_feed.py), [src/single_feed_reid.py](src/single_feed_reid.py))

**Approach:**  
- Processes detection, tracking, and re-identification for one video feed.
- Evaluates baseline performance without cross-camera complexities.
- May use simpler association logic compared to multi-camera modules.

**Why Used:**  
- Establishes a baseline for comparison with multi-camera approaches.
- Useful for scenarios with only one available camera.
- Simplifies debugging and ablation studies.

---

## 7. Utilities ([src/utils.py](src/utils.py))

**Approach:**  
- Provides helper functions for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
- Includes visualization tools for bounding boxes and tracks.
- Contains evaluation metrics and logging utilities.

**Why Used:**  
- Promotes code reuse and modularity.
- Simplifies main pipeline code by abstracting common tasks.
- Facilitates rapid experimentation and debugging.

---

## 8. Main Pipeline ([src/main.py](src/main.py))

**Approach:**  
- Orchestrates the overall workflow, calling detection, tracking, feature extraction, and mapping modules.
- Manages configuration, input/output, and experiment logging.
- Handles batch processing and parallelization if needed.

**Why Used:**  
- Centralizes execution logic for easier management and reproducibility.
- Allows for flexible experimentation with different modules and parameters.
- Streamlines deployment and integration with other systems.

---

## 9. Model Storage ([models/model.pt](models/model.pt))

**Approach:**  
- Stores pre-trained weights for detection and feature extraction models.
- Supports loading and saving model checkpoints.
- May include multiple models for different tasks.

**Why Used:**  
- Enables efficient inference without retraining.
- Leverages state-of-the-art models for improved accuracy.
- Facilitates transfer learning and fine-tuning.

---

## 10. Output and Evaluation ([output/](output/))

**Approach:**  
- Saves processed video outputs with visualized detections and tracks.
- Stores logs, metrics, and evaluation results.
- May include intermediate results for debugging.

**Why Used:**  
- Facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis of results.
- Enables comparison between different approaches and configurations.
- Supports reporting and presentation of findings.
